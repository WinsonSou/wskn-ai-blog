Hello friends, welcome back!

Today's topic is all about pre-requisites. Prerequisites are super important and they form a solid base foundation of getting Nutanix Kubernetes Platform installed in a **single shot**. It also provides helpful day 2 tools that i feel are important especially when doing troubleshooting and security.

Lets dive in!

## TL;DR

- NKP installation succeeds only when all prerequisites are in place—treat this as a checklist before you run the installer.
- Spin up a small **jumphost/bastion** (Ubuntu, Rocky, RHEL, etc.) and install the key tooling: `kubectl`, `yq`, `helm`, `k9s`, `docker`, `kubeseal`, plus optional `cilium`, `flux`, and `istio` CLIs with 2vCPUs and 8GB of RAM.
- Create and verify **DNS records** for the NKP cluster FQDN, Prism Central (PC), internal container registry, Nutanix Files & Objects endpoints.
- Issue valid **TLS certificates** for the NKP FQDN, PC, registry (and any other endpoints) with correct SANs.
- Mirror the **NKP air-gapped bundle (~15 GB)** to an **internal registry** to avoid Docker Hub rate limits and ensure a consistently quick installation experience.
- Plan **networking** early: choose pod & service CIDRs that do NOT overlap with existing LANs; ensure DHCP/IPAM hands out IP + DNS, or bake DNS into pre-provisioned hosts. Ensure IP Addresses are allocated for the Kubernetes API Server and LoadBalancer Service Range and they are excluded from the DHCP Range.
- Prepare **service accounts** for LDAP, Prism Central, Files, and Objects with the roles/permissions listed in Nutanix docs.
- Decide on centralised **authentication** (LDAP, OIDC, SAML) and collect the required bind credentials / IdP info.
- Check **compatibility**: NKP 2.15 requires Prism Central 2024.1+ and AOS 6.5/6.8+.
- Use only **supported OS versions** (Ubuntu 22.04, Rocky 9.x, RHEL 8.10, etc.). Disable swap, enable `iscsid`, trust internal CAs, size `/var/lib/containerd` generously, and include cloud-init for custom images.
- Size the cluster: **Control Plane** nodes 3 × (4 vCPU, 16 GiB RAM, 100 GiB disk); **Worker** nodes ≥ 4x (4 vCPU, 16 GiB RAM, 100 GiB disk)

With these pieces in place you’ll eliminate 90 % of install failures and be ready for a smooth NKP deployment.


## The Why

Prerequisites as mentioned in the header of this blog is super important and forms the solid foundation of Nutanix Kubernetes Platform (NKP) and subsequent actions you perform on it.

I know it's a boring topic but it's super important as i've had many colleagues, friends, customers, partners reaching out to figure out why their NKP installation is failing. Many times it's due to Docker Rate Limits or misconfigurations or subnet overlaps. The list of reasons goes on.

Hence I thought that it would be important to run through what I think are the most important prerequisites so that our adventure into NKP is as smooth as possible.

## List of Prerequisites (Simplified List)

Here's a list to ensure that you have everything you need:
- Jumphost/Bastion
- NTP
- DNS & DNS Server
- Certificates
- Registry
- Networking Configuration (Ensuring CIDRs dont overlap / DHCP..)
- Service Accounts (For LDAP / Nutanix)
- LDAP/OIDC
- NCI and PC Cluster Versions (If Deploying on Nutanix)
- Pre-provisioned OS (If Deploying on Bare Metal / Self-Provisioned VMs / CloudVMs)
- Custom BaseOS Images (If using your own images.)
- Resource Configurations for Control Plane and Worker Nodes
- Airgapped Bundle & NKP CLI (Mandatory!)

Lets break it down into their individual sections.

### Jumphost/Bastion

What do we use a Jumphost/Bastion for? Well we basically execute all the commands to install NKP, and any additional commands to do configuration changes etc. I typically like to have a dedicated Jumphost/Bastion to access my clusters instead of accessing those directly from my Mac.

Provision a small VM (Ubuntu 22.04 / Ubuntu 24.04 LTS / Rocky / RHEL) with the following tools installed. Below this section i provide a automated script for both Debian and Fedora. In my previous video i used Rocky Linux instead. Either distribution doesnt matter and it's all person preference. But since Nutanix now has a partnership with Canonical, i personally felt it was a good time to get familiar with Ubuntu.

**Use the following resource assignments:** 2vCPUs, 8GB RAM

- `kubectl` - To interact with Kuberentes
- `yq` - Great for yaml, json, etc parsing 
- `helm` - Package Manager for Kubernetes
- `k9s` - Terminal UI for Kubernetes (I really love k9s, makes troubleshooting so much easier)
- `docker` - Used to spin up the KinD (Kubernetes in Docker) Cluster for Bootstrap, and konvoy image builder to provision custom images. I prefer Docker over Podman as I've encountered `126` errors in Podman before and still havent figured a way out. You can use Podman but YMMV
- `kubeseal` - Must have. Allows us to create sealed secrets within Kubernetes
- `cilium` - Good to have, especially when we're doing more advanced Cilium Configurations 
- `flux` - Good to have, especially when we're delving deeper into GitOps
- `istio` - Good to have, especially when we're delving deeper into Istio Service Mesh
- `step-cli`- Good to have, especially if you're generating your own certificates
- `nkp` CLI - CLI tool used to install and manage NKP

#### Note the script uses sudo, so prepare your sudo password to perform the installation.
#### For my airgapped friends.. sorry! You'll need to manually download the individual RPMs/DEBs and bring it into your jumphost.

### NTP (Network Time Protocol)

Everything in Kubernetes works with TLS Certificates. Certificates are time sensitive. Key and token exchange between OIDC / SAML / LDAP are also time sensitive.

There are also other components in the entire infrastructure stack that are time sensitive (Nutanix AOS for example). Hence it makes total sense to ensure that NTP is properly configured in all aspects of infrastructure.

- Hypervisor has NTP configured (AHV / vSphere / etc) - When VMs get spun up, they get their time from the underlying hypervisor

- VMs - Ensure VMs has NTP configured. This includes the Jumphost, Registry, and Custom BaseOS images you're using for NKP deployments

### DNS & DNS Server

Everything in Kubernetes revolves around DNS. That should not be an exception for infrastructure supporting Kubernetes as well.

Having proper DNS entries ensures that you do not need to hardcode IP addresses as well as providing the capability to use certificates.

Here are some of the basic DNS entries that we definitely need to provision for. 

**1. NKP Cluster FQDN**

When we try to access our NKP cluster after post deployment, we wouldn't want to be accessing it via the IP address. 

- It isn't as secure as it's using the default self-signed certificates. 
- Better user experience. It's easier to remember `nkp-mgmt-cluster.wskn.local` vs `172.26.193.21` 😀

When we configure the FQDN DNS, the IP for the FQDN should be the **first** IP Address of your Load Balancer IP. 

e.g. if your NKP Service LoadBalancer range is `10.168.100.20-10.168.100.25`, the DNS Entry IP Address should be `10.168.100.20`.

**2. Prism Central FQDN (If deploying on Nutanix)**

When deploying on Nutanix, Prism Central (PC) is the single-pane management interface that NKP leverages heavily. Make sure a friendly FQDN (for example `pc.wskn.local`) resolves to the PC VIP so that certificates and integrations all work painlessly.

**3. Registry**

When we deploy NKP, we're going to be using a "Airgapped First" installation method. What this means is regardless if your cluster has an internet connection, we'll still be using an internal registry to host and pull our NKP container images. This is to avoid rate limits from DockerHub. Leads to a more consistent and faster installation experience.

**4. Nutanix Files**

If we're planning to use Nutanix CSI with Nutanix Files for RWX persistent volumes, ensure that we have the DNS entries for Nutanix Files provisioned.

**5. Nutanix Objects**

If we're intending to use Nutanix Objects via COSI, it's important to ensure that the DNS entries for Nutanix Objects are created as well.

### Certificates

Certificates go hand-in-hand with DNS.  At minimum you will want:

1. A certificate for the NKP cluster (e.g. `nkp-mgmt-cluster.wskn.local`). Or wildcard is fine as well.
2. A certificate for Prism Central (e.g. `pc.wskn.local`).
3. A certificate for your internal registry (e.g. `registry.wskn.local`).

**Enusure that all certificates has their SAN DNS names included**

Additional certs that you should definitely consider are also for Nutanix Objects, Active Directory / LDAP / OIDC

You can generate them with an internal PKI such as Microsoft AD CS, HashiCorp Vault, Step CA (to name a few) or use a public CA like Let's Encrypt if the names are publicly resolvable.  

In my example, i'm using step-cli to quickly create a chain of certs. But for production, definitely use an Enterprise Grade CA. The concepts are the same.

Here's how i use stepcli to generate the certificate chain.

```bash title="Step cli Generate Certificate Chain"
# Root CA - THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A BEST PRACTICE. FOLLOW YOUR ORGANIZATION'S PRACTICES!
step certificate create wskn-root-ca wskn-root-ca.crt wskn-root-ca.key --profile root-ca --not-after=87660h --no-password --insecure --kty RSA

# Intermediate CA - THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A BEST PRACTICE. FOLLOW YOUR ORGANIZATION'S PRACTICES!
step certificate create wskn-intermediate-ca wskn-intermediate-ca.crt wskn-intermediate-ca.key --ca wskn-root-ca.crt --ca-key wskn-root-ca.key --profile intermediate-ca --not-after=87660h --no-password --insecure --kty RSA

# Server Certs - THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A BEST PRACTICE. FOLLOW YOUR ORGANIZATION'S PRACTICES!
step certificate create wskn.local server.crt server.key --ca ./wskn-intermediate-ca.crt --ca-key ./wskn-intermediate-ca.key --no-password --insecure --san=wskn.local --san=*.wskn.local --san=*.*.wskn.local --not-after=87661h --kty RSA

# Concat ICA + RCA into a single CA Chain File. DO NOTE THE ORDER MATTERS!! ICA FIRST THEN RCA!
cat wskn-intermediate-ca.crt >> wskn-ca-chain.crt
cat wskn-root-ca.crt >> wskn-ca-chain.crt
```


### Internal Registry

Docker Hub rate limits will break the installation faster than you can say “429”.  
Mirror the NKP images into an internal registry that is reachable from every node.

Ensure that the registry has sufficient storage space to store minimally the Nutanix Kubernetes Platform Airgapped bundle, which is about 15GB. Provision for at least 20GB.

Here are the steps that we can use to setup our own registry. **Note this registry will only be used to host the container images used by NKP**. Not you, your organization nor your customer's container images.

The Internal Registry that we will be using will be [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/)

We do need to ensure that we have Docker and Docker Compose installed in the VM we're using for this registry. I wont cover the installation of Docker here as it's already available above in the [Jumphost](#jumphostbastion) section. 

We are also going to be using the certificate we created earlier in the [Certificates](#certificates) section.

The installation steps below works for airgapped environments as well. just make sure you download the latest offline harbor release from the [Harbor Github](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases)

```bash title="Installing Harbor" showLineNumbers
# Elevate permissions for installation

### Networking Configuration

Failure here is the #1 reason for aborted / failed installs.

1. Choose non-overlapping CIDRs:

e.g. If your local LAN subnets use 192.168.3.0/24, it is going to overlap with the default Pod Range. Make sure you change the default Pod Range.

Below are the default Pod and Service CIDRs. Once again, ensure they do not overlap with what you have in your LAN. If they do, make sure to change those during the deployment stage.

   - Pod CIDR: `192.168.0.0/16`  
   - Service CIDR: `10.96.0.0/12`

2. Plan network segments early. We need to assign IP Addresses to the Kubernetes API Server and the LoadBalancer Range. I typically have that mapped out in a spreadsheet.

2. DHCP/IPAM

If we're doing automated installs on Nutanix or vSphere (or AWS/Azure), be sure to have the Networks configured with DHCP (or IPAM in AHV). VMs that gets spun up during the automated deployment process needs to automatically get IP Addresses. Also ensure that the DHCP (or IPAM in AHV) excludes the range specified for the Kubernetes API Server and LoadBalancer Service Range. 

If we cant use DHCP or IPAM, we can still install NKP. But we'll need to rely on prepvosioned infrastructure which will also be covered in later sections.

3. DNS in DHCP/IPAM Configuration

Ensure that DNS servers are configured when your DHCP or IPAM hands out IP Addresses. If we dont use DHCP / IPAM, make sure DNS is configured in the preprovisioned VMs or Bare Metal servers.

### Service Accounts

Ensure we have service accounts created for the following at minimum:

1. LDAP (If using LDAP / Active Directory) - NKP Service Account for LDAP authentication

2. Prism Central - Ensure Prism Central is linked to LDAP / SAML and have a dedicated service account with dedicated roles for NKP. [View here for the official Infrastructure PC Role Requirements](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Nutanix-Kubernetes-Platform-v2_15:top-prism-central-custom-role-permissions-r.html) and [View here for the official Storage PC Role Requirements](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=CSI-Volume-Driver-v3_3:csi-csi-non-admin-permissions-list-r.html)

3. Nutanix Files (If using Nutanix Files for RWX PVCs) - Ensure that a REST API Access User is created in Nutanix Files. [View here for the official Documentation on Creating the REST API Access User in Nutanix Files](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Files-v5_1:fil-file-server-rest-api-access-t.html)

4. Nutanix Objects (If using COSI) - Create a user (Ideally from LDAP) Access Keys. [View here for the official Documentation on Creating Access Keys for User in Nutanix Objects](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Objects-v5_1:top-generate-access-key-t.html#ntask_ply_1rp_fhb)

I wont be covering vSphere or other cloud providers here. Esp. vSphere since i'm super rusty with regards to vSphere. But if i do touch it someday, i'll definitely add it in.

### LDAP / OIDC

Centralised auth is a must for production clusters. Choose between 1 or a combination of a few providers.

- **LDAP**: Prepare service account DN & bind password, Base DN, search filter.

- **OIDC**: Ensure you have an identity provider capable of OIDC.

- **SAML**: Ensure you have an identity provider capable of SAML.

### NCI and PC Cluster Versions (If Deploying on Nutanix)

Ensure that the version of NKP you're deploying supports the version of Prism Central and Nutanix AOS you're currently running. As of this time of this blog it's as per below:

NKP Version 2.15.0:
Prism Central 2024.1 and above
AOS 6.5, 6.8 and above

You can find the latest [here](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Nutanix-Kubernetes-Platform-v2_15:top-nutanix-environment-prerequisites-c.html)

### Preprovisioned OS (Bare Metal or Manually provisioned VMs)

Ensure that the OS that has been installed meets the supported OS requirements of NKP. As of NKP 2.15.0, we support the below:

- Ubuntu 22.04
- Rocky 9.1
- RHEL 8.10
- Flatcar 3033.3.18
- Oracle linux RH 8.9

Find the latest supported OS [here](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Nutanix-Kubernetes-Platform-v2_15:top-nkp-supported-OS-c.html)

Above and beyond all the additional hardening (FIPS, CIS L2, etc) that is done on the Preprovisioned VM or Bare Metal Server, ensure the below:
- Ensure iscsid is enabled (especially if we're going to be using RWO Network Based Storage (iSCSI))
- Make sure swap is disabled (Kubernetes doesnt support swap being enabled)
- Make sure any trusted certificates are baked into the OS (Allows the OS to automatically trust certificates generated internally within the Organization)
- Ensure /var is sufficiently sized (Container images which are pulled are stored in /var/lib/containerd. If we foresee massive container images, make sure we have ample space in /var/lib/containerd)

Not to worry, we'll have a dedicated section on Preprovisioned.


### Custom BaseOS (Automated Deployments with a Custom Image)

If we do not intend to use the Nutanix Provided Rocky Linux or Rocky Linux CIS images (and in the future Ubuntu Pro 😀), we can choose to build our own images as well.

Ensure that the Custom BaseOS that is going to be used meets the supported OS requirements of NKP. As of NKP 2.15.0, we support the below for installation onto Nutanix:

- Ubuntu 22.04
- Rocky 9.5
- RHEL 8.10

Above and beyond all the additional hardening (FIPS, CIS L2, etc) that is done on the Preprovisioned VM or Bare Metal Server, ensure the below:
- Ensure iscsid is enabled (especially if we're going to be using RWO Network Based Storage (iSCSI))
- Make sure swap is disabled (Kubernetes doesnt support swap being enabled)
- Make sure any trusted certificates are baked into the OS (Allows the OS to automatically trust certificates generated internally within the Organization)
- Ensure /var is sufficiently sized (Container images which are pulled are stored in /var/lib/containerd. If we foresee massive container images, make sure we have ample space in /var/lib/containerd)
- Ensure Cloud-Init is installed (NKP uses Cloud-Init to prepare the image to become ClusterAPI compatible)

Not to worry, we'll have a dedicated section on creating your own Custom Base Images.

### Resource Configurations for Control Plane and Worker Nodes

**Control Plane** (per node, 3 node minimum):

- 4 vCPU, 16 GiB RAM, 100 GiB disk (Ensure Disk sizes are appropriate for /var/lib/containerd)

**Worker** (per node, 4 nodes minimum):

- 8 vCPU, 32 GiB RAM, 100 GiB disk  (Ensure Disk sizes are appropriate for /var/lib/containerd)

### Air-gapped Bundle & NKP CLI (Mandatory!)

We definitely want to download the Nutanix Kubernetes Platform Airgapped bundle. We'll use this bundle to push all the container images used in Nutanix Kubernetes Platform into our Registry, so when deploying NKP, we are not encumbered by rate limits and network bottlenecks.

Once we download the Airgapped bundle, we'll push it to the Internal Registry we created above in the [Internal Registry](#internal-registry) Section.

While it's a rather chunky bundle, ~15GB large, trust me the experience after that is way better.

We'll be downloading the Airgapped bundle directly into the **Jumphost**. We can download it from the Nutanix Portal.

</p>


Below is a script that i always use to Download and push the latest airgapped bundles.

```bash title="Mirroring Airgapped Bundle" showLineNumbers
## Ensure that you change the below to your environment.
# highlight-start
export NKP_VERSION=v2.15.0
export REGISTRY_URL=registry.wskn.local/mirror
export REGISTRY_USERNAME=admin
export REGISTRY_PASSWORD=Harbor12345 #This is the default harbor password. Change to your environment
export REGISTRY_CACERT=/home/winson/certs/wskn-ca-chain.crt #ICA + RCA Chain
# highlight-end

## Replace the DOWNLOAD_LINK_URL_YOU_COPIED_FROM_THE_ABOVE_STEP with the link you got above from the Nutanix Portal
curl -Lo "nkp-air-gapped-bundle_${NKP_VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz" \
# highlight-start
    "DOWNLOAD_LINK_URL_YOU_COPIED_FROM_THE_ABOVE_STEP"
# highlight-end

## Ensure that you change <VERSION> to your actual NKP version
# highlight-start
tar zxvf nkp-air-gapped-bundle_${NKP_VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz
# highlight-end

## Ensure that you change <VERSION> to your actual NKP version
# highlight-start
cd nkp-${NKP_VERSION}
# highlight-end

## Install NKP CLI
sudo cp ./cli/nkp /usr/bin/nkp
sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/nkp
source <(nkp completion bash)
echo "source <(nkp completion bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "source <(nkp completion bash)" | sudo tee -a /root/.bashrc > /dev/null

## Load NKP Bootstrap and Image Builder Images
sudo docker load -i nkp-image-builder-image-${NKP_VERSION}.tar
sudo docker load -i konvoy-bootstrap-image-${NKP_VERSION}.tar

## Push NKP images into registry
nkp push bundle --bundle ./container-images/konvoy-image-bundle-${NKP_VERSION}.tar \
  --to-registry=${REGISTRY_URL} \
  --to-registry-username=${REGISTRY_USERNAME} \
  --to-registry-password=${REGISTRY_PASSWORD} \
  --to-registry-ca-cert-file=${REGISTRY_CACERT}

nkp push bundle --bundle ./container-images/kommander-image-bundle-${NKP_VERSION}.tar \
  --to-registry=${REGISTRY_URL} \
  --to-registry-username=${REGISTRY_USERNAME} \
  --to-registry-password=${REGISTRY_PASSWORD} \
  --to-registry-ca-cert-file=${REGISTRY_CACERT}
```

Thats it! By dilligently following all the steps above, we'll eliminate almost 90% of all the potential issues when doing installations and help us with a single shot installation.

Thanks for reading and i'll see you on the next one!
